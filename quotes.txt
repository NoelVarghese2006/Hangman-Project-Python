All that glitters is not gold.
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
Knowledge is power.
To err is human; to forgive, divine.
To thine own self, be true.
United we stand, divided we fall.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
Speak softly and carry a big stick
Nothing is certain except for death and taxes.
I think therefore I am.
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.
Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
There is no substitute for hard work.
